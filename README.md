# Diogene-s-cave
Hello this is my cave, you will find a trike that is in project and a few modified parts for delta kossel 3D printer

Trike project : The idea is to build a recyclable trike with bamboo parts as much as possible, it would be mechanically linked so each part can be removed and changed easily. The idea is to build a front wheel trike like this one : but much cheaper : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpgRIWIY_GY with 3D printed parts.
You can buy a 3D printer Anet A8 cheap but efficient enough here : https://www.geeetech.com/acrylic-geeetech-prusa-i3-pro-b-3d-printer-diy-kit-p-917.html with free shipping. You can get cheaper, I bought mine for ~150 euros it was an offer that I had because I was listening on a Anet A8 dedicated facebook account, I suppose you can get similar offers, by subscribing to their email or just ask them by mail to be notify when it does happen.
